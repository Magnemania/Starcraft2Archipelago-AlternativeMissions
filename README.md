# Starcraft2Archipelago-AlternativeMissions
Alternative mission files for the StarCraft 2 Archipelago Randomizer

To install the original Archipelago map files, go to https://github.com/TheCondor07/Starcraft2ArchipelagoData

To install an alternative map, go to the StarCraft folder where you installed the original maps, go to Maps > Archipelago Campaign, and replace the original map with one from this repository.  You may wish to rename the original map to back it up.

This repository currently only contains ap_tvalerian03.SC2Map , which is a replacement for All-In named All-Out.  This map is based on Breakout, and provides an alternative final mission to All-In.
